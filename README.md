# Netflix-Churn-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict Netflix customer churn using classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and deploy an interactive app using Streamlit for real-time predictions.

 Features
✅ EDA & Visualization: Understand churn patterns with interactive plots (Matplotlib/Seaborn).
✅ Feature Engineering: One-hot encoding, scaling, and handling missing values.
✅ ML Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost with ROC-AUC up to 91%.
✅ Deployment: Streamlit app for real-time churn prediction.
✅ Business Insights: Identify key churn drivers for strategic decision-making.

 Tech Stack
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Deployment: Streamlit, Pickle for model serialization
Tools: Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook

 Business Problem
Netflix aims to reduce customer churn and improve retention by identifying key churn predictors like subscription type, viewing habits, demographics, and payment methods.

Results
Random Forest achieved ROC-AUC: 0.91 & 87% accuracy.
Top churn drivers: subscription_type, last_login_days, and favorite_genre.
Streamlit app deployed for easy prediction and business use.
